# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This project uses two markers on a map to track the longitude and latitude of two buses on route 1 in Boston, in real time. 
I initially started with tracking one bus and added another marker for a second bus.
To run this project download the html file, js file, and css file. Open the files in VS code to modifiy the code and use your browser to see the map in action.
In the future it would be helpful to differentiate the buses using different markers and attach the bus name/title to the marker.
