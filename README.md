# Real Time Bus Tracker
## This project uses markers on a map to track the longitude and latitude of two buses on route 1 in Boston, in real time, using an API. 

#### I initially started with tracking one bus and added another marker for a second bus. 
#### To run, first clone the respository. You can drag and drop the HTML file into your broswer to view. Or navigate to the GitHub Page for this project: https://hilaryvoegeli.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracking/. To see the markers move in real-time, click the button of the corresponding bus.
#### In the future it would be helpful to show which direction the buses are moving and attach the bus number to the marker.
