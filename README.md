# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
## This project uses two markers on a map to track the longitude and latitude of two buses on route 1 in Boston, in real time, using an API. 

#### I initially started with tracking one bus and added another marker for a second bus. 
#### To run this project loacally download the html file, js file, and css file. To view in the browser, navigate to the GitHub Page for this project. https://hilaryvoegeli.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracking/
#### In the future it would be helpful to show which direction the buses are moving and attach the bus number to the marker.
